[ DEBUG ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:25.397 ][ Producer 6]   Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right

[ WARNING ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:28.556 ][ Producer 3]   Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon
[ INFO ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:28.662 ][ Producer 4] began talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I

[ WARNING ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:30.981 ][ Producer 8] rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of

[ INFO ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:32.036 ][ Producer 6] question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt
[ INFO ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:32.257 ][ Producer 3] that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she

[ WARNING ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:33.400 ][ Producer 1]   Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a

[ INFO ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:33.954 ][ Producer 7] was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in
[ INFO ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:34.360 ][ Producer 2] sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:
[ DEBUG ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:34.447 ][ Producer 7] away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it
[ INFO ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:34.463 ][ Producer 6] say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late
[ DEBUG ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:34.737 ][ Producer 4] it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the
[ DEBUG ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:34.837 ][ Producer 4] corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found
[ CRITICAL ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:35.018 ][ Producer 1] herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps
[ CRITICAL ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:35.114 ][ Producer 4] hanging from the roof.
[ CRITICAL ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:35.151 ][ Producer 7] 
[ WARNING ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:35.696 ][ Producer 3]   There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;

[ CRITICAL ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:36.337 ][ Producer 5] wondering how she was ever to get out again.
[ INFO ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:36.391 ][ Producer 7] 
[ CRITICAL ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:36.520 ][ Producer 8]   Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of
[ INFO ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:36.562 ][ Producer 4] solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,
[ CRITICAL ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:36.835 ][ Producer 0] and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the
[ DEBUG ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:36.874 ][ Producer 4] doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or
[ DEBUG ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:36.907 ][ Producer 3] the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of
[ WARNING ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:37.109 ][ Producer 4] them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low
[ CRITICAL ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:37.299 ][ Producer 2] curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little
[ INFO ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:38.163 ][ Producer 0] door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key
[ DEBUG ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:38.435 ][ Producer 8] in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

[ INFO ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:38.822 ][ Producer 5]   Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small
[ DEBUG ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:39.026 ][ Producer 1] passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and
[ INFO ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:39.605 ][ Producer 8] looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
[ CRITICAL ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:39.891 ][ Producer 2] How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about
[ WARNING ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:40.156 ][ Producer 5] among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but
[ DEBUG ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:40.542 ][ Producer 0] she could not even get her head through the doorway; `and even if
[ INFO ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:40.605 ][ Producer 7] my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of
[ DEBUG ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:40.908 ][ Producer 2] very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish

[ DEBUG ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:41.873 ][ Producer 6] had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few

[ DEBUG ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:42.025 ][ Producer 2]   There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she
[ CRITICAL ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:42.396 ][ Producer 8] went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on

[ CRITICAL ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:43.251 ][ Producer 1] telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which

[ INFO ][ 2019/12/16 17:10:45.382 ][ Producer 6] for she had read several nice little histories about children who
